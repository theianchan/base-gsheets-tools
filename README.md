# Google Sheets/Base tools

Simple tools for doing Base things in Google Sheets:

1. Email lookup
2. Batch update fields

## Email lookup
Look up a list of emails in your Base account and get links to the Lead or Contact cards if they exist. Can return both a Lead and a Contact.

Note: if multiple records of the same type are found (for example, if multiple Leads exist with the same email), only the first URL will be displayed.

### Usage

### Batch update fields 
Update fields on multiple Leads/Contacts in your Base account.
